# Changelog

All notable changes to Spatial Engine are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The product version is single-sourced in `Directory.Build.props`; update it and
this file together, then tag the release (`RELEASING.md`).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Quality metrics gate recalibrated** (ADR-0040): `.dependably` now uses
  published thresholds (cyclomatic ≤ 15, cognitive ≤ 15, nesting ≤ 4, MI
  ≥ 20, in-repo coupling ≤ 40), disables the raw LCOM4 rule (it is
  meaningless for stateless types and gates through the tool's guard-aware
  diagnoses) and sets `failOn` to `moderate`. The metrics gate drops from
  26 high findings to 3 high + 1 moderate, all genuine.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-12

First tagged release: the independently executable .NET 10 host, the browser
React + MapLibre workbench, both SDKs, the PostGIS store, and the Esri
GeoServices REST serve/consume/edit boundaries.

### Added

- **Core and contracts** — `Spatial.Core` spatial value model (coordinates,
  geometries, CRS identity, features, SGEOM/SFBAT codecs) with no
  dependencies; `Spatial.PluginSdk` interfaces over core types only.
- **In-process services** (ADR-0033) composed by DI in `Spatial.Host`:
  geometry operations on NetTopologySuite (ADR-0005/0036), CRS description and
  transformation on ProjNet, the Docker-free demo store, and the PostGIS store
  (catalogue, dataset, scan/query/write, transactions, editing).
- **Host HTTP API** — typed routes (`/api/geometry/*`, `/api/crs/describe`,
  `/api/coordinates/transform`, `/api/catalogue`, `/api/datasets`,
  `/api/features/*`, `/api/transactions/*`, `/api/demo/sleep`), structured
  `SpatialException` codes, health endpoints and an OpenAPI document.
- **SDKs** — `clients/typescript` (`@spatial/client`, generated wire types with
  drift checking) and `clients/dotnet/Spatial.Client`.
- **Browser workbench** — React 19 + TypeScript + MapLibre served by the host
  from `Spatial:WebRoot`; catalogue, map rendering and selection, typed
  operations, result preview with browser-side persistence and cancellation.
- **Esri GeoServices REST boundary** (ADR-0035/0036/0037/0038) — serving
  (`Spatial.Adapter.GeoServices`: catalog, Geometry Service, FeatureServer
  query and gated editing) and consuming (`Spatial.Provider.ArcGisRest`), on
  the shared `Spatial.Interop.Esri` codec and filter grammar. The compatibility
  claim is proven against the official ArcGIS REST JS client.
- **Quality gates and delivery** — `eng/verify.sh` (format · build · tests),
  the two end-to-end scripts, `eng/*` build helpers, the container image
  (`Dockerfile`), and the CI workflow.
