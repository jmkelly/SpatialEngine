# Changelog

All notable changes to Spatial Engine are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The product version is single-sourced in `Directory.Build.props`; update it and
this file together, then tag the release (`RELEASING.md`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Structured logging to Seq** (ADR-0045): `Spatial.Host` logs through
  Serilog — console always, Seq when `Spatial:Logging:Seq:Url`
  (`SPATIAL_SEQ_URL`) is set — with one structured event per request
  (`UseSerilogRequestLogging`, server errors at `Warning`), a startup
  summary and actionable configuration warnings. The Aspire AppHost runs a
  Seq container (`Aspire.Hosting.Seq`) and injects its endpoint; the host
  still runs with no Seq (ADR-0018). Diagnostics carry configuration
  *state* only, never a connection string or token.
- **Map composer** (`architecture/map-composer-plan.md`): a workbench
  screen that composes engine datasets into an ordered, styled MapLibre
  preview — add catalogue datasets or upload GeoJSON/NDJSON/CSV inline,
  reorder layers by drag and drop, style them, and publish the composition
  as a neutral feature or map service through the existing
  `PUT /api/publications/{name}` and `POST /api/ingest` routes. Loads and
  deletes existing services, preserving their stable layer ids. No host
  contract, SDK or ADR change; per-layer style stays a client-side authoring
  aid until the MapServer render model lands.
- **Raster rendering pipeline** (ADR-0044, plan R0–R3): the core-typed
  `IMapRenderer`/`IRasterOperations` contracts and DTOs in
  `Spatial.PluginSdk`, the `Spatial.Rendering.Skia` vector rasterizer
  (MapLibre-subset `background`/`fill`/`line`/`circle`, attribute filters,
  zoom windows, bbox pushdown, screen-space simplify/cull) and the
  `Spatial.Imagery.Vips` NetVips imagery pipeline
  (read/normalise/compose/encode). The host serves `POST /api/render` and
  `GET /api/render/capabilities`, configured by `Spatial:Rendering` and
  `Spatial:Imagery`; the .NET and TypeScript clients expose `RenderAsync` /
  `render`. Tiles, the GeoServices `export` seam, labels and a GPU backend
  remain (R4–R7).
- **Ingest codec** (ADR-0041): `Spatial.Interop.Ingest` decodes GeoJSON,
  newline-delimited GeoJSON and CSV uploads into canonical `FeatureBatch`
  pages with inferred schemas (`DatasetDecoder.Decode`). Core-only; no host
  wiring yet.
- **Ingest and publication SDK contracts** (ADR-0041):
  `IPublicationRegistry` with the core-typed
  `Publication`/`PublicationKind`/`PublicationLayer` runtime service registry,
  and the additive `IDatasetIngest`
  (`IngestRequest`/`IngestOutcome`/`IngestIdentity`) atomic bulk
  create-and-load capability. Contracts only — implementations, the host
  admin API and the Esri admin projection land in later phases of
  `architecture/publishing-and-ingest-plan.md`.

### Changed

- **Quality metrics gate recalibrated** (ADR-0040): `.dependably` now uses
  published thresholds (cyclomatic ≤ 15, cognitive ≤ 15, nesting ≤ 4, MI
  ≥ 20, in-repo coupling ≤ 40), disables the raw LCOM4 rule (it is
  meaningless for stateless types and gates through the tool's guard-aware
  diagnoses) and sets `failOn` to `moderate`. The metrics gate drops from
  26 high findings to 3 high + 1 moderate, all genuine.
- **Research code excluded from the metrics gate**: `.dependably` ignores
  `**/research/**`, so research probes are never measured as product code.

### Removed

- **Rendering research spike** (`research/rendering/spike/RenderSpike`): the
  throwaway vertical slice is deleted now that its findings are promoted into
  ADR-0044 and the production `Spatial.Rendering.Skia` /
  `Spatial.Imagery.Vips` projects. Its measured results remain recorded in
  `research/rendering/README.md`. Because `crap4dotnet` globs every `.csproj`
  under the solution directory (ignoring solution membership), the spike had
  produced 21 of the 22 CRAP gate findings; only the known
  `PostgisEwkb.WritePoint` coverage-matching artifact remains (see HANDOFF.md).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-12

First tagged release: the independently executable .NET 10 host, the browser
React + MapLibre workbench, both SDKs, the PostGIS store, and the Esri
GeoServices REST serve/consume/edit boundaries.

### Added

- **Core and contracts** — `Spatial.Core` spatial value model (coordinates,
  geometries, CRS identity, features, SGEOM/SFBAT codecs) with no
  dependencies; `Spatial.PluginSdk` interfaces over core types only.
- **In-process services** (ADR-0033) composed by DI in `Spatial.Host`:
  geometry operations on NetTopologySuite (ADR-0005/0036), CRS description and
  transformation on ProjNet, the Docker-free demo store, and the PostGIS store
  (catalogue, dataset, scan/query/write, transactions, editing).
- **Host HTTP API** — typed routes (`/api/geometry/*`, `/api/crs/describe`,
  `/api/coordinates/transform`, `/api/catalogue`, `/api/datasets`,
  `/api/features/*`, `/api/transactions/*`, `/api/demo/sleep`), structured
  `SpatialException` codes, health endpoints and an OpenAPI document.
- **SDKs** — `clients/typescript` (`@spatial/client`, generated wire types with
  drift checking) and `clients/dotnet/Spatial.Client`.
- **Browser workbench** — React 19 + TypeScript + MapLibre served by the host
  from `Spatial:WebRoot`; catalogue, map rendering and selection, typed
  operations, result preview with browser-side persistence and cancellation.
- **Esri GeoServices REST boundary** (ADR-0035/0036/0037/0038) — serving
  (`Spatial.Adapter.GeoServices`: catalog, Geometry Service, FeatureServer
  query and gated editing) and consuming (`Spatial.Provider.ArcGisRest`), on
  the shared `Spatial.Interop.Esri` codec and filter grammar. The compatibility
  claim is proven against the official ArcGIS REST JS client.
- **Quality gates and delivery** — `eng/verify.sh` (format · build · tests),
  the two end-to-end scripts, `eng/*` build helpers, the container image
  (`Dockerfile`), and the CI workflow.
