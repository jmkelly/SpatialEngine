"""Reclaim stale beads leases without stealing work from a live agent.

    python3 tools/bd-safe-reclaim.py                    # recover what is safe
    python3 tools/bd-safe-reclaim.py --dry-run          # report only
    python3 tools/bd-safe-reclaim.py --older-than 90m   # wider grace window
    python3 tools/bd-safe-reclaim.py --heartbeat <id>   # worker: renew my lease
    python3 tools/bd-safe-reclaim.py --db <path>        # another queue entirely

`bd reclaim` is the right primitive and the wrong tool for a swarm. It keys on
lease age alone: a lease goes stale when its holder stops heartbeating, and a
long-running worker does not heartbeat, so "expired" only means "this agent has
not run `bd heartbeat` lately". One coordinator tick (2026-09-28) reclaimed
eight leases that paseo still reported as running, dropping live work back into
`bd ready` where the next tick would double-claim it (SpatialEngine-u2x.30).

So recovery here has two inputs: beads says when a lease *could* be reaped, and
paseo says whether the agent working that bead's branch is *actually* alive. A
bead is reclaimed only when both agree. A bead whose lease is stale but whose
agent is running (or merely idle) is reported and left in place — the safe
outcome is to leave in-flight state alone and let the human look, since the
recoverable case here is a dead worker, not a fast one.

Liveness is matched two ways, both of which the runbook already produces:

  * the bead's branch, `bd/<id>`, resolved through `paseo workspace ls` to its
    worktree, compared against the cwd of every live agent. A live agent's cwd
    is that worktree, so the bead is held. The fallback when the workspace is
    not listed compares the worktree directory slug `bd-<id-with-dots-as-dashes>`
    as an exact path segment, so `bd-spatialengine-u2x-2` never matches a bead
    id of `SpatialEngine-u2x.21`.
  * the agent id the coordinator recorded in the bead's notes (`agent <id>`),
    which narrows the same worktree test to the agent that claimed this bead
    rather than to any agent id the notes happen to carry.

Anything else is reported, not guessed: the beads side is the authority on
staleness, and this tool never extends a lease it did not read as expired.

Every `bd` call goes through one place, `bd_args`, so `--db` can point the
whole run — reads and the reclaim alike — at a queue that is not the
repository's shared `.beads` database. That is how a test or a rehearsal runs
this tool without touching in-flight work (SpatialEngine-k0p).
